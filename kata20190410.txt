Best Sellers
------------

Very naive:
- update from query on all sales records in existing sales DB

Naive:
- store per product ID and hour (rotating 24-hour buffer) the # of sales
- traverse whole table at the end of each hour, find top sellers
- memory: 24 * # product IDs * length product ID, e.g. 24 * 10 Mio * 8 bytes = 1.84 GB, possible in memory

Alternative data structure:
- store per hour (rotating buffer of 24 elements) the # of sales per product ID
- requires fewer slots for product IDs, store only those occurring per hour
- memory: 24 * # product IDs per hour * length product ID, e.g. 24 * 1 Mio * 8 bytes = 184 MB, easily possible in memory

Smarter update:
- keep count total per product ID in addition to hourly values
- on update, subtract counts from 24 hours ago, add counts from current hour (no need to traverse all 24 slots)
- requires an additional record per occurring product ID, e.g. 10 Mio * 8 bytes = 80 MB

Easier problem:
- top sellers for the current day
- requires storing one set of counts only

Real time update:
- requires full timeline of all sales
