Kata10: Hashes vs. Classes
--------------------------

* Classes

+ Inheritance, code re-use for similar tasks
+ Clearly defined interface and data structure
+ Strongly typed, reduces errors

- Harder to extend (logic + data fields)
- Code Overhead
- Inheritance can become complicated


* Dictionaries

+ 'Only the data'
+ Business logic separated from data structures
+ Easily extensible, trivial serialization

- Data structure requires explicit documentation
- Loosely typed, more error prone
- More difficult to implement validation, default values etc.
